# Cache_Memory
# This project simulates a cache memory system to analyze its performance under various configurations using memory trace files. The simulation models a set-associative cache, where each cache line is represented by a structure containing a valid bit, a tag, and an LRU (Least Recently Used) counter for replacement management. The program allows users to experiment with different cache sizes, block sizes, and associativities, while it tracks the number of cache hits and misses for each configuration. It then calculates and outputs the hit and miss rates for each memory trace into a CSV file, helping evaluate how efficiently the cache configuration works with real-world memory access patterns.
